Basically, whatever is salvaged outside of https://github.com/MutaMan/Reproduction-mod because cataclysm deserves romance mechanics with NPCs and I couldn't get the original to work.

Unfortunately you cannot have offspring like in the original mod but I don't see the point of that in the first place since very rarely you will play a game enough for a baby to grow. 

### Installation
Simply extract to a folder in your mods folder
